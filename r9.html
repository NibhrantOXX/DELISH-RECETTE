<p>If you haven't heard about this famous sweet, have you ever been living in this world? Mysore Pak is a Karnataka sweet made with a concoction of ghee, sugar, and gram flour. It was first created in the kitchens of Mysore Palace during the regime of Raja Wadiyar IV and now has become people’s favourite dessert.</p>
<p>To prepare this famous dish,here's the recipe </p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>INGREDIENTS REQUIRED:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup Gram flour (besan)</li>
    <li>1-1/4 cups Ghee</li>
    <li>1-1/4 cups Sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup Water</li>
</ul>
<P style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Here are the steps that you need to follow---></b></P>
<ol>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Preparation--></b></p>
<li>Firstly take all the 3 ingredients 1.25 cups sugar (200 to 210 grams sugar), 1 cup besan (100 grams) and 1 cup ghee (200 to 210 grams).                                </li>            
<li>Sieve the besan once or twice. This helps in reducing the lumps if any while mixing besan in the sugar syrup.</li>
<li>A pic of the sifted besan below.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Grease a pan or tray with some ghee. Use a pan or tray which can give you some depth and height, so that you can get rectangular or square pieces of mysore pak.</li>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Making the Sugar Solution--></b></p>
<li>Now take the sugar in a heavy thick bottomed kadai. Since a lot of stirring happens, I would suggest you to Use a heavy and large aluminium or iron kadai. Please do not use non stick pan as due to the heat and lot of stirring, the non stick coating can get affected.</li>
<li>Add 1/2 cup water in the sugar.</li>
<li>Keep the pan on the stove top. On a medium-low or medium flame, heat the sugar syrup.</li>
<li>Stir so that the sugar dissolves.</li>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Heating Ghee(clarified Butter)---></b></p>
<li>Simultaneously also take the ghee in another pan and keep it on stove top.</li>
<li>Let the ghee melt on a low flame or sim. The ghee has to be hot when we add it in the besan mixture. So let it be on a slow simmer.</li>
<li>Let the sugar syrup start bubbling and boiling. We are not looking for one string consistency in the sugar syrup. Just let the sugar solution come to a boil and then we have to add the besan.</li>
<li>Add the besan in three to four parts. First add some of the besan.</li>
<li>With a wired whisk, stir the besan briskly, so that it dissolves with the sugar solution.</li>
<li>With one hand, add the besan and with the other hand mix it with a wired whisk.</li>
<li>Finish of all the besan this way.</li>
<li>Stir very well, so that the besan has got mixed evenly with the sugar syrup.</li>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Adding Ghee---></b></p>
<li>Then add ghee in parts. First add a ladle full of the ghee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </li>
<li>You will see a lot of bubbles and frothing in the besan mixture after you add ghee.</li>
<li>As soon as you add ghee, mix it with the besan with a spoon or spatula. With one hand add ghee and with the other hand mix it.</li>
<li>Then add the second part of ghee and again mix it very well. Keep the flame to a medium-low or medium.</li>
<li>This way finish off adding all the ghee in parts. Mix very well.</li>
<li>Do use a bigger kadai and also some gloves on your hands, as there is a lot of sizzling, frothing and bubbling that happens.</li>
<li>All the ghee will be absorbed first and what you will see is a smooth molten besan mixture.</li>
<li>Stirring non-stop and cooking further</li>
<li>On a medium-low to medium flame with non-stop stirring cook the besan mixture.</li>
<li>You have to continue to cook and stir till you start seeing many bubbles in the mixture and the ghee is released from it. The mixture will also start to leave the sides of the kadai or pan.</li>
<li>So continue to cook and stir.</li>
<li>While stirring also scrape the bottom of the kadai and the sides. If you do not scrape, then the mixture starts sticking and gets browned or burnt. So you have to non stop stir and scrape. Do use flat steel spatula (palta) as this helps in scraping the besan mixture.</li>
<li>When the mixture comes together in one mass and you see some ghee at the sides, then also continue to stir and scrape.</li>
<li>When you see many small bubbles and holes in the mixture, then switch off the flame. When you reach this stage, you have to be attentive as a few seconds here or there and it will ruin the texture of the mysore pak.</li>
<li>If you cook too much, then you will get a very hard mysore pak. The following pic, shows you the texture to get a hard mysore pak. Thus do not cook till you come at this stage. This photo was taken when working on a disaster recipe. Sharing the photo to show the difference.</li>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Setting mysore pak---></b></p>
<li>Immediately and quickly tilt the kadai and pour the whole mixture in the greased pan.</li>
<li>It falls in one lot and you don’t need to use any spoon for it.</li>
<li>Level with a spatula or the back of small glass or a small steel bowl.</li>
<li>Let the mysore pak mixture become warm or cool down. If there is too much ghee at the sides or top, then invert the pan after 20 to 30 minutes, so that the excess ghee is removed.</li>
<li>You can use this ghee while preparing dosa or greasing idli plates. once warm or cooled down, then just invert the pan on a chopping board or tray or plate. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan. The mysore pak block falls of easily.</li>
<li>Then slice the mysore pak. Store in an air-tight container. Mysore pak stays good for about a week to ten days at room temperature.</li>
