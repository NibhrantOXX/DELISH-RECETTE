<P style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>Here are the steps that you need to follow---></b></P>
<ol>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>TO MAKE THE GATTAS---></b></p>
<li>In a big bowl, add all the ingredients for the gattas.</li>
<li>Mix all the ingredients well together, and then adding water little by little, knead a stiff dough. </li>
<li>Roll the dough into a large cylinder of 1inch thickness and divide the cylinder further into 1inch cubes.</li>
<li>Boil the 3 cups of water in a deep pot.Once the water boils, add the gattas gently into the water and cook them for 5 to 8 minutes.Once cooked the gattas will rise to the top.</li>
<li>Once they rise, using a sieve drain the water and keep the gattas aside.  </li>
<li>Now heat oil in a deep bottomed pan on high heat. Make sure at least 2/3rd of the pan is covered with the oil.</li>
<li>Once the oil is hot, drop in the strained gattas gently, one at a time, and deep fry them until golden brown.Take them out with a slotted spoon and leave them on a paper towel to drain excess oil.</li>
<li>Repeat the same process with the rest of the gattas. </li>
<p style="font-size:30px;text-decoration:underline;"><b>TO MAKE THE KHICDI---></b><p>
<li>Mix the dal and rice in a sieve. Wash the dal and rice together, rinsing well under running water.</li>
<li>Once washed, transfer them to a bowl, and add enough water to cover the dal and rice mix. Soak it in the water for 10-15 minutes. </li>
<li>In a deep, thick bottomed and sturdy pot, boil 21/2 cups of water. Once the water comes up to a boil, drain the water off the dal-rice mix, and add the mix to the pot of boiling water. Stir it in and cover the pot.</li>
<li>On a medium heat, let the dal and rice cook together in the covered pot, until done. This should take about 15 minutes. Remember to take the lid off at intervals, and stir this mix, till cooked.</li>
<li>Now on a medium heat, heat the ghee in a deep,cast iron or non-stick pan. Once the ghee is hot, add the asafoetida, cumin seeds and mustard seeds.</li>
<li>Once the seeds crackle, add the red chillies, cloves and whole black pepper and saute for 4 to 5 seconds. Now add the ginger, garlic and green chilies and saute again for 3 to 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Now add turmeric powder, the cooked rice and dal, the fried gattas and the fried onions and salt and mix well to make sure the cooked rice and dal are mixed well with the ghee tempering. Do so gently, so you donâ€™t break the gattas. Cook on medium flame for 2 minutes more and stirring continuously but gently.</li>
<li>Done. Serve hot with a bowl full of curd and pickle, or with kadi.</li>
